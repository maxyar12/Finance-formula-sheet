# Finance-formula-sheet

Coming from physics, I often found it difficult to recall the exact definition of basic formulas such as those for computing compound interest.
This Formula sheet is an attempt to keep alot of formulas (from finance) in one place. Images do not belong to me - they are from wikipedia - please reference them appropriately.

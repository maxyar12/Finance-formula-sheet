# Finance-Learning

This repository contains a finance formula sheet in latex as well as a time series exploration in R (in the .Rmd file).

Coming from physics, I often found it difficult to recall the exact definition of basic formulas such as those for computing compound interest.
This Formula sheet is an attempt to keep alot of formulas (from finance) in one place. Images do not belong to me - they are from wikipedia - please reference them appropriately.

The time series exploration looks at the idiosyncratic return of AAPL vs the correlation to the market. E.g. this analysis examines alpha and beta by performing a linear regression against the SP500 over the same time period of the series.
